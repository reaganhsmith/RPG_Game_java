# Overview
This is my first ever java project! I wanted to implement the basics of Java into a fun text game.  a game where the user gets to select their path and journey. I was able to accomplish this using a variety of Java built-in tools, if statements and lots of functions! I really loved being able to be creative with this project. I was excited to learn Java because it is used in a lot of video game creation and has been around for so long! 

When I started this project I wanted to understand the basics of Java. I focused on using variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions and data structures to help create my game. Through this project I was able to learn a small amount of Java. It makes me want to learn more about Java and follow other tutorials to expand my knowledge of it. I plan on finding time to continue to learn Java and learn how it is used in the gaming world.

# Future Work

- Figure out how to make is so when your health hits 0 the games instantly ends.
- Add a timer so that things take a second to load and the player has time to read the events happening. 
- Implement different classes to hold a vareity of the code so it is not in one class.
